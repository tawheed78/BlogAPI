# BlogAPI

This is a RESTful API for a blog, built using Django and Django Rest Framework.

## Installation

## Usage

1. To authenticate, send a `POST` request to `http://localhost:8000/login/` with your credentials (username and password) in the request body.
2. You will receive a JWT token in the response.
3. Use the token in the `Authorization` header of subsequent requests to the protected endpoints.
4. Use the available endpoints to create, read, update, and delete posts and comments, as well as like and search for posts.

## Endpoints

- `GET /` - retrieve all posts
- `GET /search/` - search for posts by keyword
- `POST /create/` - create a new post
- `GET /<int:pk>/` - retrieve a post by ID
- `PUT /<int:pk>/update/` - update a post by ID
- `DELETE /<int:pk>/delete/` - delete a post by ID

- `POST /login/` - authenticate user and receive a JWT token
